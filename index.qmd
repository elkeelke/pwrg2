\section*{Abstract}
Remote sensing, in particular satellite-based Earth Observation, provides extensive datasets that hold potential for supporting life cycle assessments (LCAs) to evaluate environmental impacts across a product or service life cycle. This project work performs a case study for integrating remote sensing data in LCA to determine if and how observational satellite data can be integrated into LCA to enhance the accuracy of environmental impact evaluations in various stages, especially in the inventory and modeling phases. 

A promising area where such data might be applied is for the evaluation of changes in surface reflectivity (albedo) associated with the installation of photovoltaic panels (PV). This can be assessed from the relevant satellite data before and after the installation of the PV sites under study, for both building mounted PV panels and open ground PV installations in deserts, on grasslands, on croplands, or on water surfaces. Depending on the type of land cover there might be net positive, neutral, or net negative effects. For most cases, net positive effects are expected. The change in surface albedo caused by replacing natural or built surfaces with PV panels is expected to represent a significantly smaller environmental impact compared to the environmental benefits of solar power over non-renewable energy sources. However, it constitutes a measurable effect that can potentially be quantified and incorporated into LCAs. 

The structure of the project work is as follows. Following the introduction, a review of existing literature on the incorporation of albedo changes into LCA, as well as the use of remote sensing based metrics to support this integration, will be presented. The central contribution of the work will be the design of a detailed research project plan including methodological steps, project milestones, and a time plan. For the interested reader, the appendix provides introductory overviews of life cycle assessment and satellite-based Earth observation for readers seeking background information on these topics.

Grading consists of the following parts: Scientific Publication: 50\%, Supporting Material 15\%, Oral Presentation 25\%, Work Process / Project Management: 10\%

# Introduction

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as defined in [@ISO14040] and [@ISO14044] is a standardized tool used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with every stage of a product or service's life, from raw material extraction through production, use, and disposal. Central to the accuracy and usefulness of an LCA is the availability and quality of the underlying data. Without robust and representative data, the conclusions drawn from an LCA risk being misleading or incomplete. LCA methodologies often rely on aggregated impact factors, which can be globalized or regionalized. High spatial variability intrinsic to environmental phenomena can not be captured with this approach. 

Remote sensing, particularly through satellites, provides vast amounts of data. Satellites offer a unique, large-scale perspective for continuous observation of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. They collect data that can be directly or indirectly used to assess land cover, vegetation health, surface temperatures, atmospheric gases, and ocean characteristics. All of these are essential for understanding environmental trends and changes over time. Satellite derived Earth Observation (EO) data is continuously collected and supports a wide range of applications, from climate modeling and disaster response to agricultural planning. In particular, EO data allows (1) to assess if a certain location is currently covered by a solar panel, and (2) measure the reflectivity in that location before and after the installation. 

Albedo is the ratio of solar energy reflected by a surface. Light surfaces (e.g. snow and ice) reflect a large portion of the sunlight while dark surfaces like asphalt do not reflect it but instead absorb the sunlight and convert it into heat. Therefore, when the albedo of Earth’s surface or atmosphere changes, the planet’s energy balance is altered. The planetary boundaries framework @richardson2023earth lists surface albedo changes after greenhouse gases and aerosols as the third key anthropogenic driver in the climate change category, which is measured in (1) atmospheric CO₂ concentration and (2) energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere. The change in the balance between incoming and outgoing energy is known as radiative forcing (RF). This effect drives weather patterns, surface temperatures, and consequently, the climate system.  

Solar panels convert sunlight into both electrical energy and heat. Since PV installations typically replace existing surfaces with lower-albedo PV modules, they alter the surface reflectivity and, consequently, the local and global energy balance. Today's solar panels are all in the typical dark color. Architects like to use other lighter colors, especially for facade installations. This is realised by installing lighter colored glass panels in front of the solar panel, which reduces their efficiency. Efforts to improve the performance of colored panels, such as those described by @ji2019vivid, are ongoing and will take time to reach practical application. 

The aim of this work is to devise a project plan to (1) quantify the impact of albedo changes associated with dark-colored PV installations and to (2) integrate this effect into life cycle assessments (LCAs) of photovoltaic systems. While ISO14040 [@ISO14040] provides the necessary structure for an LCA, it refrains from dictating specific methodological approaches for emerging or complex environmental phenomena, such as the albedo effect and radiative forcing. This absence of prescriptive methods allows for the integration of additional data sources, e.g EO data, in LCAs.

# Literature study

Several research areas relate to this topic, including albedo effects in general, albedo effects of photovoltaic (PV) systems, albedo effects inclusion in life cycle assessment (LCA), and remote sensing applications for location-specific LCAs. This chapter provides an overview of existing studies in these fields that are relevant to the present work.

## Albedo effects compared between surfaces

@susca2012enhancement proposed an enhancement of the LCA methodology with a time-dependent climatological model for including the effect of surface albedo on climate. They evaluated their theoretical findings with a case study of a black and a white roof evaluated over the time frames of 50 and 100 years. The comparative life cycle impact assessment of the two roofs showed that the white high surface albedo played a crucial role in offsetting RF.

@hasler2024accounting find that maximizing the climate benefits of tree cover restoration requires accounting for albedo effects since they often offset or even reverse carbon removal gains, especially in dryland and boreal regions. Using spatial data, the study shows that while many restoration projects target  climate-positive areas, many face an albedo offset of at least 20%. The study suggests to roll out large-scale tools to identify where restoration delivers true net climate benefits.

@loeb2025emerging use 24 years of satellite observations to show that the difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in both absorbed solar radiation (ASR) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is small but measurable. The emerging darkening of the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern Hemisphere is linked to changes in aerosol radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor distributions. This hemispheric asymmetry in radiation is closely connected to variations in the atmosphere and ocean general circulation. Understanding how clouds respond to this developing imbalance is critical for predicting future climate evolution.

## PV installations and albedo effects

While many scientific publications on PV and LCA overlook the effects of surface albedo change, such as @gerbinet2014life, @ferrara2024life, @gomez2024agile, a limited number of studies have attempted to quantify the effect in a way that could be used as in input to an LCA:

*   @nemet2009net estimated the effects of covering Earth with sunlight absorbing panels on a large scale and therefore reducing surface albedo. They found that avoided emissions from PV generated energy were far greater than the observed warming effect from the related albedo reduction. 

*   @wei2024small confirmed these results based on global satellite data, and also showed that albedo induced positive radiative forcing can be offset by negative radiative forcing from clean solar generation in most PV farms within one year.

*  @xu2024global performed a global assessment of the effects of solar farms on albedo and vegetation for 116 large solar farms using MODIS data. They demonstrated that the installation of these farms decreased the annual mean surface shortwave albedo and reduced the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) relative to the surrounding areas. The greatest impacts on albedo were observed in barren land, followed by grassland and cropland, while the opposite order applied for vegetation impact. In terms of seasonal and latitudinal variations, the largest impact on albedo was observed at high latitudes in winter. 

## Albedo effects of PV installation per original surface

Other studies investigated the impact of PV on radiative forcing on several different installation sites such as city roofs, deserts, alpine locations, and lakes:

*   @zhou2025assessing used a LiDAR-based approach to quantify urban albedo for the city of Delft assuming that all appropriate roofs would be covered with PV panels and found that this would yield 485.72 GWh of electric energy per year, while it would minimally lower the city’s albedo and impose $3.53 * 10^{-8}W/m^2$ positive RF. The results were validated using MODIS satellite observations. 

*  @li2022comparative examined the effects of PV panels on surface radiation through a comparative study between a PV site and a reference site in the Gobi area of Xinjiang, China in summer 2020. The results showed that nighttime outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) was lower at the PV site, while daytime values were similar. The PV site’s surface albedo (0.14) was 39.1% lower than the reference site’s (0.23). Overall, net radiation was 30.7% higher at the PV site: 75% due to reduced upward short wave radiation, and 25% to lower nocturnal long wave radiation.

*  @wang2025environmental studies PV installations in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau and found an increased net radiation, by 28.9%, but reduced albedo and wind speed, by 31.6% and 36.2%. Air temperature rose in daytime and summer, but dropped at night and in winter. Soil under panels was colder and drier, while gaps were colder and wetter, extending the frozen period by ~50 days and slowing moisture loss up to 3.5×. These shifts alter local energy and water balances and may moderate climate warming impacts, warranting longer-term multi-year studies to evaluate the long-term impacts on vegetation dynamics and permafrost processes.

*  @li2022physical examined fishery complementary PV plants (FPV) using a physical model to reveal their microclimatic effects. FPV deployment turned the lake into a heat sink, reducing albedo by 18.8%. Water energy change was driven by an water–air vapor pressure deficit. Also, the FPV panels warmed the surrounding environment, with heating intensity depending on water depth and strongest at the surface.

The conclusion is that on each of these surfaces, impacts on albedo caused by the PV installations could be observed that could potentially be included in an LCA.

## Albedo effects in LCAs

Several studies from the LCA research community have attempted to quantify albedo related effects for inclusion in LCAs: 

*  @david2025 assessed whether accounting for surface albedo change caused by land use change in carbon credit quantification methods influences the amount of credits and found that overcrediting can happen because planting trees can darken the land.

*  @jungbluth2012life presents collected data on the albedo effects from various surfaces including PV panels. While the direct impact on global radiative forcing is considered minimal, local albedo changes induced by large PV installations could have minor implications for nearby ecosystems and microclimates. 

*  @bright2012climate examines two key dynamic factors affecting bioenergy’s climate impact: temporary changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle, and land surface albedo. The paper proposes ways to integrate these factors into LCA. Using a case study of transportation biofuel from managed boreal forests in northern Europe, the authors develop global warming potential (GWP) indices for different land management scenarios, highlighting the need for region-specific characterization factors and discussing related uncertainties.

*  @cai2016consideration quantified land use change (LUC) induced albedo effects from large-scale U.S. biofuel production and compared them with greenhouse gas emissions from traditional life-cycle analyses. Using over 1.4 million satellite albedo observations across six Agro-Ecological Zones, paired with high-resolution crop data, they modeled radiative forcing related impacts of LUC for seven crop types. Results show average albedo effects of −1.8 g CO₂e/MJ for corn ethanol (cooling), +2.7 g CO₂e/MJ for miscanthus, and +12.1 g CO₂e/MJ for switchgrass (warming). Strong spatial variability indicates that biofuel climate impacts depend heavily on local land and vegetation characteristics.

## Spatially explicit LCAs

Spatially explicit LCAs are a refinement of traditional LCAs to incorporate geographical and location-specific information into the assessment of environmental impacts. The key difference is the use of location specific inventory data for different purposes, such as for example road infrastructure planning as described by @karlsson2017. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing are often used to map and quantify regional effects. 

@itten2023remote explored how remote sensing data from satellites can support and partly replace company provided data for scope 3 reporting to improve transparency and enable comparisons. The interdisciplinary researcher group identified remote sensing data sources for agriculture, mining, and energy sectors. The satellite images must be processed to extract usable LCA information, such as land use change or transport distances. Commercial providers already offer relevant ESG oriented remote sensing based data products. These datasets on land use, biodiversity, and biomass carbon can enable regionalized and consistent LCI models across larger areas and time periods.

@li2021spatializing provide a meta study of 105 publications on GIS-based LCAs and propose a universal methodology framework to address the following issues: (1) how to set up a geographically referenced system in the goal and scope definition phase; (2) how to spatialize lifecycle data and integrate and compute foreground and background data in the inventory analysis phase; (3) how to develop spatialized characterization factors with different requirements on resolution and data availability in the impact assessment phase; and (4) how to uniform the contribution analysis of different zones, unit processes, and elementary flows to visualize spatialized environmental footprint in the interpretation phase. 

@paris2023accuracy discusses issues caused by inconsistencies between the actual data and the information derived from satellite data that can be attributed to factors such as differences in viewpoint perspectives, i.e., aerial versus ground views, or spatial resolution of the satellite images versus the extent of the land cover (LC) present in the scene. TBD many such issues exist.

Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017 through 2024.

# Research questions

Three main research questions are explored: 

1.   How can satellite-derived remote sensing data be applied to assess changes in surface albedo resulting from PV installations by comparing its effects before and after the installation? What level of spatial and temporal data aggregation is required to obtain meaningful results, given the quality and resolution of the data? The hypothesis is that the inherent noise found in satellite-derived remote sensing data (e.g. due to varying weather conditions and cloud cover) along with its limited spatial resolution will represent major constraints to be dealt with. Nevertheless, it is expected that it will be possible to derive statistically significant result estimates with appropriate data processing and statistical methods.

1.   How does the original surface of PV systems, such as building or open ground, influence the amount of albedo change from the installation? Is it feasible to identify the original surface such as buildings, deserts, grasslands, croplands, water? Is it possible to assess and quantify the albedo change by original surface type? Furthermore, is seasonality (e.g., temporal snow cover and vegetation dynamics) a relevant factor? The hypothesis is that the impact will depend on the original surface being replaced. Albedo changes for building mounted PV panels are expected to be minor since the albedo of typical dark roofing is expected to be similar to that of a solar panel surface. However, for other surfaces such as deserts, the changes in albedo might be significant.

1.   How can the satellite-derived data be incorporated into LCAs in a methodologically sound and credible manner, enabling its authoritative use in environmental impact assessments of solar energy systems? The hypothesis is that satellite-derived datasets from sources such as U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) are considered reliable and scientifically validated. The expectation is that the given data quality should allow for quantifying aggregated albedo changes by original surface type and consequently support the incorporation of these effects into LCAs of photovoltaic systems.

# Appendix

## Overview: Satellite data for earth observation

This chapter provides an introduction to satellites that provide observational data of the Earth for environmental monitoring. The many other existing use cases for satellites in communication, broadcasting, navigation, and for military purposes will not be discussed.

:::

There are several different types of methods to sense the data: optical, thermal, and radar based as summarized in @tbl-methods. Optical methods detect sunlight reflected by clouds, land, and oceans, e.g., for red and blue visible light reflectance. Near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) is invisible to the human eye. NIR is strongly reflected by vegetation, and absorbed by water. Therefore, NIR based methods make land cover, plant health, and boundaries between land and water easy to detect. IR detects thermal radiation, i.e. heat, emitted from the Earth and atmosphere at day and night. This is useful for observation of temperature and moisture or dryness as well as atmospheric gaseous water vapor. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active method that works at night and through clouds (unlike the other methods). It detects surface structure and moisture.

At a high level, satellites can be categorized based on their orbital types, which determine their position and altitude, and consequently coverage and purpose: 

1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites orbit at altitudes between 160 and 2.000 kilometers. They are known for their high resolution data. A subset of them, polar orbits, pass over the Earth's poles and provide global coverage as the planet rotates beneath them. Another subset is sun-synchronous orbits, which maintain a consistent position relative to the sun, allowing satellites to observe the Earth under similar lighting conditions with each pass. 

1. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites operate at altitudes ranging above 2.000 and below 35.000 kilometers. They are typically used for navigation services such as devised based on Assisted Global Navigation Satellite Systems as defined in [@3gppagnss], which rely on acquiring and decoding satellite signals to determine their position. 

1. Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites are located above the equator at 35.786 kilometers, which matches the Earth's rotation period, to provide continuous observation of a fixed region of the Earth. They are known for providing low resolution data with high update frequency. The data provided is often used for weather and broad climate monitoring.

Each of these orbital satellite types serves different purposes. The satellite orbital types most common for earth observation are LEO and GEO satellites. In the following, an overview of available public domain and commercial observational satellite data of these types that could potentially be relevant for LCA is provided.

### Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites

Observational Geostationary Earth Orbit satellites provide continuous, real-time monitoring of atmospheric conditions, cloud cover, sea surface temperatures, and solar radiation over large fixed regions. They have lower spatial resolution compared to LEO satellites, but this is being compensated by providing high temporal resolution. @tbl-geo-satellites provides an overview of the existing GEO satellites, their operators, the regions covered, the type of access and, if relevant, the license that the data is available under.

:::

The three satellite series where data that is accessible under open licenses offer data delivery frequencies between 5 and 15 minutes for full images. They provide similar imaging capabilities: 16 spectral ranges of wavelengths, called bands or channels, collected by the satellite sensor as discrete portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each series provides comparable numbers of optical, near-infrared and infrared channels.

They support rapid scan modes for their regions of focus with data delivery frequencies between 30 seconds and 5 minutes. These are used for detecting fast-changing weather and environmental events such as storms, tornadoes, wildfires and volcanic eruptions, and for short-term weather forecasting (called now-casting). 

To summarize, GEO satellites for Earth observation are most helpful for high-frequency monitoring of large-scale land and ocean processes.

### Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites

Far more LEO satellites for Earth observation than GEO satellites exist: around 35 GEO satellites compared to around 1000 LEO satellites. @tbl-leo-satellites provides a non-exhaustive listing of the most relevant providers together with the resolution and revisit frequency of the data provided. Note that some providers have more than one satellite on offer. In these cases only the one with the highest resolution and revisit frequency is listed. The newest satellites are Biomass from ESA for forest biomass and carbon content monitoring, and FireSat and OroraTech for wildfire detection. The (*) sign indicates future plans.

To summarize, LEO satellites play a crucial role in Earth observation, particularly for high-resolution and frequent monitoring. The revisit frequency is primarily determined by the size of the satellite constellation. Larger constellations, such as those with over 100 satellites, can achieve revisit frequencies approaching those of geostationary systems. 

### Data availability for research purposes

While a few public providers offer open-access data with comparatively low resolution, many different commercial options for very high resolution data are on the market. The pricing models of the commercial options depend on the amount of data required and the use case, and are available upon request. Limited opportunities to access the commercial data under a research license exist. The NASA-led Commercial Satellite Data Acquisition Program @csda_nasa provides access to some of the data for research purposes, most notably for the Maxar WorldView data. It has been used in a number of scientific articles as assessed by @zhao2022overview who conducted a literature study of scientific articles referencing EO satellite missions and found that their number is exponentially growing, and while some cite commercial sources, most of the work is based on the freely available data. In this project, the focus will be on data that is available for research purposes.
