\section*{Abstract (Research proposal)}
Remote sensing, in particular satellite-based Earth Observation, provides extensive datasets that hold potential for supporting life cycle assessments (LCAs) to evaluate environmental impacts across a product or service life cycle. This project work performs a case study for integrating remote sensing data in LCA to determine if and how observational satellite data can be integrated into LCA to enhance the accuracy of environmental impact evaluations in various stages, especially in the inventory and modeling phases. 

A promising area where such data might be applied is for the evaluation of changes in surface reflectivity associated with the installation of photovoltaic panels (PV). This can be assessed from the relevant satellite data before and after the installation of the PV sites under study, for both building mounted PV and open ground PV installed in deserts, on grasslands, on croplands, or on water surfaces. Depending on the type of land cover there might be net positive, neutral, or net negative effects. For most cases, net positive effects are expected. The change in surface albedo caused by replacing natural or built surfaces with PV panels is expected to represent a significantly smaller environmental impact compared to the environmental benefits of solar power over non-renewable energy sources. However, it constitutes a measurable effect that can potentially be quantified and incorporated into LCAs. 

The structure of the project work is as follows. Following the introduction, a review of existing literature on the incorporation of albedo changes into LCA, as well as the use of remote sensing–based metrics to support this integration, will be presented. The central contribution of the work will be the design of a detailed research project plan including methodological steps, project milestones, and a time plan. The appendix will provide introductory overviews of life cycle assessment and satellite-based Earth observation for readers seeking background information on these topics.

Grading consists of the following parts: Scientific Publication: 50\%, Supporting Material 15\%, Oral Presentation 25\%, Work Process / Project Management: 10\%

# Introduction

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as defined in [@ISO14040] and [@ISO14044] is a standardized tool used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with every stage of a product or service's life, from raw material extraction through production, use, and disposal. Central to the accuracy and usefulness of an LCA is the availability and quality of the underlying data. Without robust and representative data, the conclusions drawn from an LCA risk being misleading or incomplete. LCA methodologies often rely on aggregated impact factors, which can be globalized or regionalized. High spatial variability intrinsic to environmental phenomena can not be captured with this approach.

Remote sensing, particularly through satellites, provides vast amounts of data. Satellites offer a unique, large-scale perspective for continuous observation of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. They collect data that can be directly or indirectly used to assess land cover, vegetation health, surface temperatures, atmospheric gases, and ocean characteristics. All of these are essential for understanding environmental trends and changes over time. Satellite derived Earth Observation (EO) data supports a wide range of applications, from climate modeling and disaster response to agricultural planning. In particular, EO data allows (1) to assess if a certain location is covered by a solar panel, and (2) measure the reflectivity in that location. TBD: Since EO data is continuously collected and available in archives (?), it is possible to go back in time and measure the reflectivity before the solar panel installation as a comparison point.

Albedo is the ratio of solar energy reflected by a surface. The energy that is not reflected is absorbed by the Earth's surface and converted into heat. This absorbed heat is energy that drives weather patterns, surface temperatures, and consequently, the climate system. 

TBD: Since PV installations typically replace natural high-albedo surfaces with much darker PV modules, this results in a net decrease in surface reflectivity and, in turn, higher energy balance. 

While ISO14040 [@ISO14040] provides the necessary structure for an LCA, it refrains from dictating specific methodological approaches for emerging or complex environmental phenomena, such as the Albedo effect. This absence of prescriptive methods allows for the integration of additional data sources, e.g EO data, in LCAs.

LCA mainly introduces biodiversity as an endpoint category modeled as a loss in species richness due to the conversion and use of land over time and space. The functional and population effects on biodiversity are mostly absent due to the emphasis on species accumulation with limited geographic and taxonomical reach. Current land-use modeling activities that use biodiversity indicators tend to oversimplify the real dynamics and complexity of the interactions of species among each other and with their habitats.

# Tools and datasets

In the following, datasets and tools that could be valuable as input for LCAs are assessed.

Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017 through 2024.

# Project proposal

Reflectivity of PV panels impacts surface albedo. Plan a project to quantify this effect.

## Research questions

The PV panels will replace either naturally high or naturally low albedo surfaces depending on the site of installation. 

For buildings the integration of PV panels i would expect a neutral effect with the Albedo of building roof being similar to the Albedo of PV panels. There might be special cases e.g. where the building roofs a painted white, but for most cases the difference should not very relevant.

Two main research questions are explored. First, how can satellite-derived remote sensing data be applied to assess changes in albedo resulting from PV installations? Second, how can such data be incorporated into LCAs in a methodologically sound and credible manner, enabling its authoritative use in environmental impact assessments of solar energy systems?

Albedo changes for building mounted PV might be very minor (as the finding of the delft study shows), a change of -0.0306 will not cause a relevant change in the energy balance.

For open ground installations of PV, I would expect an increase in Albedo and accordingly a reinforcing positive impact. PV panel convert some of the sunlight to electricity and reflect more light than e.g. grasslands or forests.

## Overview: Satellite data for earth observation

This chapter provides an introduction to satellites that provide observational data of the Earth for environmental monitoring. The many other existing use cases for satellites in communication, broadcasting, navigation, and for military purposes will not be discussed.

:::

There are several different types of methods to sense the data: optical, thermal, and radar based as summarized in @tbl-methods. Optical methods detect sunlight reflected by clouds, land, and oceans, e.g., for red and blue visible light reflectance. Near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) is invisible to the human eye. NIR is strongly reflected by vegetation, and absorbed by water. Therefore, NIR based methods make land cover, plant health, and boundaries between land and water easy to detect. IR detects thermal radiation, i.e. heat, emitted from the Earth and atmosphere at day and night. This is useful for observation of temperature and moisture or dryness as well as atmospheric gaseous water vapor. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active method that works at night and through clouds (unlike the other methods). It detects surface structure and moisture.

At a high level, satellites can be categorized based on their orbital types, which determine their position and altitude, and consequently coverage and purpose: 

1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites orbit at altitudes between 160 and 2.000 kilometers. They are known for their high resolution data. A subset of them, polar orbits, pass over the Earth's poles and provide global coverage as the planet rotates beneath them. Another subset is sun-synchronous orbits, which maintain a consistent position relative to the sun, allowing satellites to observe the Earth under similar lighting conditions with each pass. 

1. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites operate at altitudes ranging above 2.000 and below 35.000 kilometers. They are typically used for navigation services such as devised based on Assisted Global Navigation Satellite Systems as defined in [@3gppagnss], which rely on acquiring and decoding satellite signals to determine their position. 

1. Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites are located above the equator at 35.786 kilometers, which matches the Earth's rotation period, to provide continuous observation of a fixed region of the Earth. They are known for providing low resolution data with high update frequency. The data provided is often used for weather and broad climate monitoring.

Each of these orbital satellite types serves different purposes. The satellite orbital types most common for earth observation are LEO and GEO satellites. In the following, an overview of available public domain and commercial observational satellite data of these types that could potentially be relevant for LCA is provided.

### Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites

Observational Geostationary Earth Orbit satellites provide continuous, real-time monitoring of atmospheric conditions, cloud cover, sea surface temperatures, and solar radiation over large fixed regions. They have lower spatial resolution compared to LEO satellites, but this is being compensated by providing high temporal resolution. @tbl-geo-satellites provides an overview of the existing GEO satellites, their operators, the regions covered, the type of access and, if relevant, the license that the data is available under.

:::

The three satellite series where data that is accessible under open licenses offer data delivery frequencies between 5 and 15 minutes for full images. They provide similar imaging capabilities: 16 spectral ranges of wavelengths, called bands or channels, collected by the satellite sensor as discrete portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each series provides comparable numbers of optical, near-infrared and infrared channels.

They support rapid scan modes for their regions of focus with data delivery frequencies between 30 seconds and 5 minutes. These are used for detecting fast-changing weather and environmental events such as storms, tornadoes, wildfires and volcanic eruptions, and for short-term weather forecasting (called now-casting). 

To summarize, GEO satellites for Earth observation are most helpful for high-frequency monitoring of large-scale land and ocean processes.

### Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites

Far more LEO satellites for Earth observation than GEO satellites exist: around 35 GEO satellites compared to around 1000 LEO satellites. @tbl-leo-satellites provides a non-exhaustive listing of the most relevant providers together with the resolution and revisit frequency of the data provided. Note that some providers have more than one satellite on offer. In these cases only the one with the highest resolution and revisit frequency is listed. The newest satellites are Biomass from ESA for forest biomass and carbon content monitoring, and FireSat and OroraTech for wildfire detection. The (*) sign indicates future plans.

-->

To summarize, LEO satellites play a crucial role in Earth observation, particularly for high-resolution and frequent monitoring. The revisit frequency is primarily determined by the size of the satellite constellation. Larger constellations, such as those with over 100 satellites, can achieve revisit frequencies approaching those of geostationary systems. 

### Data availability for research purposes

While a few public providers offer open-access data with comparatively low resolution, many different commercial options for very high resolution data are on the market. The pricing models of the commercial options depend on the amount of data required and the use case, and are available upon request. Limited opportunities to access the commercial data under a research license exist. The NASA-led Commercial Satellite Data Acquisition Program @csda_nasa provides access to some of the data for research purposes, most notably for the Maxar WorldView data. It has been used in a number of scientific articles as assessed by @zhao2022overview who conducted a literature study of scientific articles referencing EO satellite missions and found that their number is exponentially growing, and while some cite commercial sources, most of the work is based on the freely available data. In this project, the focus will be on data that is available for research purposes.
