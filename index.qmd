\section*{Abstract}
The aim of this work is to create a project proposal to demonstrate ability as a student to get an overview of a research field, summarize the findings, identify a gap in the existing knowledge, define a research question, and a project plan to tackle it. 

In the first part of the paper, a literature study of the state of the art for using remote sensing generated data in life cycle assessments (LCAs) is performed. Based on that, a proposed project is developed and described in detail. The final part of the paper includes a project plan.
