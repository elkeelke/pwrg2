\section*{Abstract}
The aim of this work is to create a project proposal to demonstrate ability as a student to get an overview of a research field, summarize the findings, identify a gap in the existing knowledge, define a research question, and a project plan to tackle it. 

The chosen topic is using remote sensing, in particular satellite data, for life cycle assessments (LCAs). In the first part of the paper, a literature study of the state of the art is performed. As the outcome of this study, a research gap is identified. Based on that, a proposed project to close the gap will be developed and described in detail. The final part of the paper includes a project plan.

# Introduction

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a standardized tool used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with every stage of a product or service's life, from raw material extraction through production, use, and disposal. Central to the accuracy and usefulness of an LCA is the quality and availability of data. Reliable data allows to quantify energy use, emissions, resource depletion, and other key metrics, making it possible to compare alternative options, and to support informed decision-making. Without robust and representative data, the conclusions drawn from an LCA risk being misleading or incomplete.

Remote sensing, particularly through satellites, provides vast amounts of data. Satellites offer a unique, large-scale perspective for continuous observation of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. They collect data that can be directly or indirectly used to assess land cover, vegetation health, surface temperatures, atmospheric gases, and ocean characteristics. all of which are essential for understanding environmental trends and changes over time. Satellite-derived data supports a wide range of applications, from climate modeling and disaster response to agricultural planning.

The focus of this work is to explore how satellite data can be integrated into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to enhance the accuracy and scope of environmental impact evaluations in various stages of the LCA, especially in the inventory and modeling phases, where detailed and geographically specific information can improve the reliability of results. While remote sensing supplies the observational data, LCA offers the framework for quantifying and interpreting the environmental impacts.
