\section*{Abstract}
The aim of this work is to create a project proposal to demonstrate ability as a student to get an overview of a research field, summarize the findings, identify a gap in the existing knowledge, define a research question, and a project plan to tackle it. 

The chosen topic is using remote sensing, in particular satellite data, for life cycle assessments (LCAs). In the first part of the paper, a literature study of the state of the art is performed. As the outcome of this study, a research gap is identified. Based on that, a proposed project to close the gap will be developed and described in detail. The final part of the paper includes a project plan.

# Introduction

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as defined in @ISO14040 and @ISO14044 is a standardized tool used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with every stage of a product or service's life, from raw material extraction through production, use, and disposal. Central to the accuracy and usefulness of an LCA is the quality and availability of data. Reliable data allows to quantify energy use, emissions, resource depletion, and other key metrics, making it possible to compare alternative options, and to support informed decision-making. Without robust and representative data, the conclusions drawn from an LCA risk being misleading or incomplete.

Remote sensing, particularly through satellites, provides vast amounts of data. Satellites offer a unique, large-scale perspective for continuous observation of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. They collect data that can be directly or indirectly used to assess land cover, vegetation health, surface temperatures, atmospheric gases, and ocean characteristics. All of these are essential for understanding environmental trends and changes over time. Satellite-derived data supports a wide range of applications, from climate modeling and disaster response to agricultural planning.

The focus of this work is to explore how satellite data can be integrated into LCA to enhance the accuracy of environmental impact evaluations in various stages, especially in the inventory and modeling phases, where accurate, detailed, and geographically specific information can improve the reliability of results. While remote sensing supplies the observational data, LCA offers the framework for quantifying and interpreting environmental impacts.

# Satellite data: types, use cases, data availability, and tools

At a high level, satellites can be categorized based on their orbital types, which determine their position and altitude, and consequently coverage and purpose. 

1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites orbit at altitudes between approximately 160 and 2,000 kilometers. They are known for their high resolution data. A subset of LEO, polar orbits, pass over the Earth's poles and provide global coverage as the planet rotates beneath them. Another subset is sun-synchronous orbits, which maintain a consistent position relative to the sun, allowing satellites to observe the Earth under similar lighting conditions with each pass. 

1. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites operate at altitudes ranging above 2,000 and below 35,786 kilometers. They are typically used for navigation services. 

1. Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites are located above the equator at  35,786 kilometers, which matches the Earth's rotation period, to provide continuous observation of a fixed region of the Earth. The resulting atmospheric data is often used for weather and broad climate monitoring.

Each of these orbital types serves different observational and communication purposes based on their unique geometries. In this work, the focus is on observational data and its use cases for LCA. There are many use cases for satellites for communication, broadcasting, navigation, and military purposes, which will not be discussed.

The satellite orbital types most useful for application in LCA are LEO and GEO satellites. In the following, an overview of available public domain and commercial satellite data that could be relevant for LCA is provided.
